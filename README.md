### How I Built the Email Sending Feature

When I started building the email sending feature, my goal was to create something that was not only functional but also secure and maintainable. Here's a walkthrough of my thought process and the steps I took to bring it to life.

My first priority was figuring out how to handle the email credentials safely. Hardcoding them was out of the question, so I brought in the `flutter_dotenv` package. This let me create a `.env` file to store the Gmail email and an App Password, which I then made sure to exclude from source control by adding it to `.gitignore`. It's a simple but crucial step for security.

Next, I needed the tools to actually send the email and handle attachments. For this, I chose the `mailer` package, which is a popular and reliable choice for SMTP integration in Flutter. To allow users to add attachments, I used the `file_picker` package, which provides a straightforward way to open the device's file browser.

To keep the code organized, I structured the project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. I centralized all the business logic in a `MailController`, which acts as the "Controller" in this pattern. I'm a fan of GetX for state management because it pairs nicely with MVC, helping to keep the UI code (the "View") cleanly separated from the logic. This controller became the 'brain' of the operation, handling everything from user input to the final sending process.

Inside the controller, I set up the connection to Gmail's SMTP server using the credentials loaded securely from the `.env` file. The core of the controller is the `sendMail` function. This function first validates all the user inputsâ€”nobody wants to send an email with a missing subject! Then, it carefully assembles the email message, adds any attachments the user selected, and passes it to the `mailer` package to be sent. I also wrapped the sending logic in a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle any network issues and provide clear feedback to the user with a success or error message.

The final piece of the puzzle was connecting the UI to the `MailController`. I linked all the buttons and text fields to the corresponding methods and variables in the controller. I used GetX's `Obx` widgets to make the UI reactive. This means that when a user adds an attachment, for example, the screen updates automatically without any extra work. It makes for a really smooth user experience.

Overall, I'm happy with how this architecture turned out. It's secure, self-contained, and thanks to the MVC pattern, the clear separation of concerns makes it easy to understand and build upon in the future.
